# Introduction

# Theoretical Framework

The observed data is considered a *count composition*, which is a specific type of compositional data (Boogart et al. 2013, p. 34). 
The counts can be seen as proportional to the relative sizes of the parts of a whole.

## Likelihood function

$$
p(\mathbf{x}_i \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}i) = \text{Multinomial}(\mathbf{x}i; m_i, \mathbf{p}i(\boldsymbol{\theta}i)) = \frac{m_i!}{\prod{j=1}^{D} x{ij}!} \prod{j=1}^{D} p{ij}(\boldsymbol{\theta}i)^{x{ij}}
$$

$$
\log p(\mathbf{x}i \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}i) = \sum{j=1}^{D} x{ij} \log p_{ij} 
$$
